# Extension Exporter

`Extension Exporter` is a Chrome extension designed to export the names and URLs of all your installed extensions into an HTML file. This extension is the reimagined edition of the previously available extension named `Export links of all Extensions`, which was removed from the Chrome Web Store due to security concerns. This extension is designed with security in mind, and is fully open-source to ensure transparency and safety. The icon has also been redesigned from the original.

## Features

-   Export extension names and URLs into an HTML file.
-   Easy-to-use with a simple interface.
-   No remote servers or external dependencies, everything is done locally.

## Open Source

This extension is fully open-source to ensure transparency and security. You can view and contribute to the source code on https://github.com/asheroto/Extension-Exporter
