# Extension Exporter

`Extension Exporter` is a Chrome extension designed to export the names and URLs of all your installed extensions into an HTML file. This extension is the reimagined edition of the previously available extension named `Export links of all Extensions`, which was removed from the Chrome Web Store due to security concerns. This extension is fully open-source to ensure transparency and safety. The icon has also been redesigned from the original.

## Features

-   Export extension names and URLs into an organized HTML file, with enabled and disabled extensions clearly separated
-   Easy-to-use: just click the extension button at the top-right of your browser and the HTML file is generated instantly
-   All code runs locally: extension does not make any connection to remote servers
