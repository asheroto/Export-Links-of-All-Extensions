# Extension Exporter

Extension Exporter is a Chrome extension designed to export the names and URLs of all your installed extensions into an HTML file. This extension is the reimagined edition of the previously available extension named 'Export links of all extensions', which was removed from the Chrome Web Store due to security concerns. This extension is fully open-source to ensure transparency and safety. The icon has also been redesigned from the original.

## Features

-   Export installed extension names and URLs into an organized HTML file, with enabled and disabled extensions clearly separated
-   Easy-to-use: just click the extension button at the top-right of your browser and the HTML file is generated instantly
-   All code runs locally: extension does not make any connection to remote servers

## Installation

This extension is available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extension-exporter/doikmfpjbcjjimnbablebijofdbgfepb). This is the recommended installation approach. Alternatively you can install the CRX file in releases.

## Open Source
